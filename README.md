# Regex to NFA Visualizer

## 🔍 About the Project

This is a web-based **Regex to NFA Visualizer** tool that helps users understand how regular expressions are converted into their equivalent **Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)** using **Thompson's Construction Algorithm**.

You can input a regular expression and instantly visualize its NFA structure with interactive graph diagrams. The tool also allows you to **test input strings** against the generated NFA to see if they are accepted.
